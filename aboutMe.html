                    I enjoy runing in my free time and am passionate about shopping. I like to cook a lot of delicious
                    food,
                    although I often fail, but I think cooking is a happy thing and I am not afraid of failure.

                <h3>Website Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people give up cooking on their own because their cooking is not good or it is difficult to
                    cook. I want to make a website that teaches cooking, mainly about simple dishes, each dish takes
                    less
                    than half an hour to make, so that people who visit the website can cook delicious food easily
                    and
                    quickly.</p>

                <h3>Website Target</h3>
                <p>
                    website target:My target group is people who don't have much free time in their daily life, but
                    want to
                    cook for themselves. Most of the selected recipes can be completed within 1 hour.

            <div class="inner-box">
                <h3>Website Development</h3>
                <p>
                    The search function is still missing from the website, which is due to the high technical
                    difficulty, in addition to the fact that there is not much content on the website and setting up the
                    search function is not very useful.</p>
                <p>In the first assignment, I completed the prototype of the website and created the basic web
                    architecture. Architecture.</p>
                <p>In the second assignment, I added two pages, image gallery and image map, and created a detailed
                    description of the recipes. In index.html, when you click on the video you are interested in, you
                    You will see an enlarged version of the video and how to make it. Likewise, you can see how to make
                    the recipe in the image gallery. I've added the category feature to index.html.</p>
                <p>In the third assignment, I fixed some bugs, such as blacksheet before specifying the length, now it
                    is overwritten directly on top of the image. I added three functions, share recipe function, share
                    to community media and browse Social Networking Feeds. For the share recipe function users can
                    upload dish name, dish picture video etc. and then you can see the shared content at the bottom of
                    the page. In addition to this, I have added alternative css functionality to the About Me page.
                    Added the introduction of About My Site.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to study this course this semester. Through both
                    theoretical learning and practical application, I have gained valuable knowledge in HTML/CSS,
                    JavaScript, andtheart of designing a successful website, which involves various factors. Before
                    taking this course, I used to believe that combining attractive photos, paragraphs, and videos would
                    create a
                    good website. However, after completing this course, I realized that my previous understanding was
                    flawed. A well-designed website requires more than just good content; it needs a user-friendly
                    interface,
                    smooth interactivity, sensible layout, appealing visual design, and accessibility. Additionally,
                    website security and maintenance are crucial aspects to consider. Now, let me share my insights on
                    website design.</p>
            </div>

            </div>


            <div class="inner-box">
                <h3>Website Design Process</h3>
                <p>Front-end development can be divided into two parts: design and implementation, both of which go
                    hand in hand. To design an exceptional front-end, we need to start with creating an appealing visual
                    style. Firstly, we define the goals and purpose of the website. For instance, my website aims to
                    help people prepare delicious meals quickly by providing simple recipes. Next, we gather the necessary
                    materials, such as recipe tutorials and videos. Then, we create the website's architecture, which is
                    a vital step that involves considering multiple factors. We can use various layout techniques, such as
                    float, grid, or flexbox, to assist in constructing the website. We place the desired content in suitable
                    locations, such as keeping the navigation bar at the top of the webpage and featuring captivating
                    recipes in prominent positions. Different areas of a webpage attract varying levels of user attention, so
                    we need to consider what elements will engage users and encourage them to spend time exploring our
                    site. During this process, we also consider style design by utilizing CSS to define fonts, colors,
                    positions, and more. Moreover, we must accommodate the diverse needs of users, including hearing, vision,
                    cognitive processing, and manual dexterity, ensuring our website caters to a broad audience. After
                    constructing the website's structure, we optimize it for different devices through responsive design
                    to ensure a seamless browsing experience. Finally, we test and optimize the website to ensure that all
                    content displays correctly before publishing and maintaining it.

            </div>


            <div class="inner-box">
                <h3>Insights Into Implementation</h3>
                <p>Moving on, I would like to discuss my insights during the implementation phase. One aspect that
                    left a lasting impression on me is the security of JavaScript. When attempting to access local files
                    using JavaScript, I discovered that it is not feasible. Further research revealed that JavaScript
                    primarily serves as a client-side scripting language, handling user interactions, manipulating webpage
                    elements, and performing asynchronous operations within the user's web browser. This introduces security
                    risks because malicious actors can manipulate or exploit JavaScript code to execute unauthorized
                    actions on a user's device. Therefore, JavaScript imposes strict limitations on directly accessing sensitive
                    files and performing certain actions. Additionally, I believe understanding the usage of containers in
                    HTML is essential. For instance, we can use "header" for the header section, "footer" for the footer
                    section, "nav" for navigation, "div" for creating block-level elements, and so on. In layouts, we often
                    utilize nested containers to wrap other HTML elements for better organization and structure.

            <div class="inner-box">
                <h3>Other Impressive Contents Of Lectures</h3>
                <p>Lastly, besides learning about website design, this course also introduced me to the concepts of
                    web
                    security and literature review. I gained knowledge about common web threats such as spoofing,
                    DoS
                    attacks, tampering, and countermeasures against them. When designing websites, we need to be
                    security-conscious and implement necessary measures to protect sensitive data. After building
                    the
                    website, we employ various testing methods to identify vulnerabilities and ensure network
                    security.
                    Furthermore, the lecture on literature review techniques was invaluable. We learned about the
                    IMRD
                    structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) and adopted the 4S system (Skim, Scan,
                    Select,
                    Summarize) for effective reading. Taking notes during the reading process enhanced our memory
                    retention
                    and comprehension.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>To conclude, this course has provided me with a wealth of knowledge in website design. However,
                    it is important to note that creating a perfect front-end website requires continuous learning beyond
                    what we acquire in the classroom. The teacher can only guide us on learning approaches and methods, but
                    it is up to us to pursue further knowledge and absorb it effectively.</p>
